# Conversation Fork (Experimental)

Thinking shouldn't be a one-way street. In complex explorations, we often need to return to a crucial node and try different possibilities.

With the **Conversation Fork** feature, Gemini Voyager allows you to branch out your thoughts and explore parallel universes of your chat.

## How it Works

> **⚠️ Note**: This is an experimental feature. You need to enable it first by clicking the extension icon in your browser toolbar to open the settings popup, and turning on the **Enable Conversation Fork** switch.

Whenever you want to take a different path, simply hover over your prompt and click the **Fork** button:

Voyager will instantly capture the entire context from the beginning up to that point and **start a brand-new conversation** for you.

In this new branch, you can freely modify your question and explore different directions without worrying about destroying your original chat history. Unleash your creativity and curiosity!
